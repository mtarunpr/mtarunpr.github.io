I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at Harvard studying computer science and mathematics. I'm fortunate to have [Nada Amin](https://namin.seas.harvard.edu/people/nada-amin) as my advisor and to have previously been advised by [Madhu Sudan](https://madhu.seas.harvard.edu/). My research interests lie in the field of algorithms and complexity theory, especially in the context of approximation algorithms and constraint satisfaction problems.
